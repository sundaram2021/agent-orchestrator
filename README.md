# ReverbCode

A Go-backed agent orchestration daemon for supervising parallel coding-agent
sessions, with an `ao` CLI today and an Electron supervisor planned. The Go
module and packages remain `agent-orchestrator`; "ReverbCode" is the public name.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the backend mental model
and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the contributor / worker contract.

## What's shipped today

- Loopback-only HTTP daemon (`backend/internal/httpd`) controlling projects,
  sessions, orchestrators, and hook callbacks over `127.0.0.1`.
- `ao` Cobra CLI (`backend/cmd/ao`) — a thin client over the daemon for daemon
  control, project/session/orchestrator management, and worker spawning.
- Worker/orchestrator spawn into isolated `git worktree` workspaces, launched
  inside a `zellij` runtime adapter.
- Live per-PR observation via the provider-neutral SCM observer
  (`backend/internal/observe/scm/`): polling loop, ETag guards, semantic
  diffing, CI/check/review-thread tracking, and lifecycle nudges for CI
  failures, review feedback, and merge conflicts.
- Agent adapters under `backend/internal/adapters/agent/`: `claude-code`,
  `codex`, `opencode`, `grok`, `cursor`, `qwen`, `copilot`, `kimi`, plus
  shared activity-dispatch / hook utilities.
- SQLite store (`backend/internal/storage/sqlite/`) with sqlc-generated
  queries, DB-triggered change-data-capture into `change_log`, and a CDC
  poller/broadcaster (`backend/internal/cdc/`) feeding in-process subscribers
  and an SSE replay endpoint.
- Session lifecycle manager + reaper (`backend/internal/lifecycle/`,
  `backend/internal/observe/reaper/`): runtime/activity/PR facts reduced into
  the small durable session state, display status derived at read time.

## Quick start

Requirements: Go 1.25+, [`zellij`](https://zellij.dev/) on `PATH` for the
runtime adapter, and `gh` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) if you want the SCM observer to
authenticate against GitHub. The SQLite driver is the pure-Go
`modernc.org/sqlite` — no system SQLite library is required.

```bash
cd backend
go build -o /tmp/ao ./cmd/ao

# Start the daemon and wait for /readyz.
/tmp/ao start

# Register a local git repo as a project. The id defaults to the lowercased
# base of --path; pass --id explicitly when the directory name doesn't match.
/tmp/ao project add --path /path/to/your/repo --id your-repo --name your-repo

# Spawn a worker session running the default agent.
/tmp/ao spawn --project your-repo --prompt "Refactor the auth module"

# Inspect what's running.
/tmp/ao status
/tmp/ao session ls
```

## CLI surface

The CLI is intentionally thin: every product command resolves to a daemon HTTP
route. Run `ao <command> --help` for the authoritative flag shape; the table
below groups what's on `main` today.

| Lane | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Daemon | `ao start` | Start the daemon in the background and wait for `/readyz`. |
| Daemon | `ao stop` | Graceful shutdown via loopback `POST /shutdown`. |
| Daemon | `ao status` | Report PID/port/health/readiness from `running.json`. |
| Daemon | `ao daemon` | Hidden internal entrypoint used by `ao start`. |
| Project | `ao project add` | Register a local git repo as a project. |
| Project | `ao project ls` | List registered projects. |
| Project | `ao project get <id>` | Fetch one project. |
| Project | `ao project rm <id>` | Remove a project. |
| Session | `ao spawn` | Spawn a worker session in a registered project. |
| Session | `ao session ls` | List sessions (filter by project, include terminated). |
| Session | `ao session get <id>` | Fetch one session. |
| Session | `ao session kill <id>` | Terminate a session. |
| Session | `ao session rename <id> <name>` | Rename a session. |
| Session | `ao session restore <id>` | Relaunch a terminated session. |
| Session | `ao session cleanup` | Reclaim eligible workspaces for terminated sessions. |
| Session | `ao session claim-pr <session> <pr>` | Attach an existing PR to a session. |
| Orchestrator | `ao orchestrator ls` | List orchestrator sessions. |
| Messaging | `ao send` | Send a message to a running agent session. |
| Utility | `ao doctor` | Local health checks (config, data dir, DB, `git`, `zellij`). |
| Utility | `ao completion <shell>` | Generate bash/zsh/fish/powershell completions. |
| Utility | `ao version` | Print build metadata. |
| Internal | `ao hooks <agent> <event>` | Hidden adapter hook callback. |

See [`docs/cli/`](docs/cli/) for the daemon-control intent and command shape.

## Configuration

All configuration is env-driven; the daemon takes no config file. The bind
host is hard-coded to `127.0.0.1` — the daemon has no auth, CORS, or TLS, and
exposing it beyond loopback would be a security regression.

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AO_PORT` | `3001` | Bind port; daemon fails fast if taken. |
| `AO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `60s` | Per-request timeout (Go duration). |
| `AO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `10s` | Graceful-shutdown hard cap. |
| `AO_RUN_FILE` | `<UserConfigDir>/agent-orchestrator/running.json` | PID + port handshake path. |
| `AO_DATA_DIR` | `<UserConfigDir>/agent-orchestrator/data` | SQLite DB, WAL files, managed state. |
| `AO_AGENT` | `claude-code` | Default agent adapter id used by `ao spawn`. |
| `AO_SESSION_ID` | _(unset)_ | Set inside spawned sessions; read by `ao send` and `ao hooks`. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Used by the GitHub SCM and tracker adapters. Falls back to `gh auth token`. |

Health check:

```bash
curl localhost:3001/healthz
curl localhost:3001/readyz
```

## Architecture

The daemon is a long-running supervisor. Adapters observe external facts (PR
state, agent activity, runtime liveness); the lifecycle manager reduces those
into a small set of durable session facts (`activity_state`, `is_terminated`,
PR rows). Display status is _derived_ from those facts at read time — it is
never stored. SQLite triggers append every user-visible change to `change_log`,
and the CDC poller broadcasts those events to in-process subscribers and an
SSE stream.

Full mental model and load-bearing rules: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).
Package-by-package ownership: [`docs/backend-code-structure.md`](docs/backend-code-structure.md).

## Testing

The local gate is the backend Go build and race-enabled test suite:

```bash
cd backend && go build ./... && go test -race ./...
```

GitHub Actions is the authoritative pre-merge gate; mirror its commands here
when in doubt. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the regen workflow when
touching the daemon API surface (`npm run sqlc`, `npm run api`).

## Status and roadmap

Current `main` ships the CLI surface above, the SCM observer end-to-end
(issues [#75](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/75),
[#108](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/108),
[#109](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/109)), the agent
adapter platform, and the CDC pipeline with SSE replay. The Tracker observer
([#112](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/112)) and live
`pr_*` event consumers ([#110](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/110))
are in flight. The Electron supervisor under `frontend/` is still a placeholder
shell — daemon logic stays in the Go backend.

## Contributing

Repo layout and the worker contract live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Keep
changes surgical, follow the package boundaries documented in
[`docs/backend-code-structure.md`](docs/backend-code-structure.md), and prefer
adding daemon HTTP routes over leaking storage / runtime into the CLI.
